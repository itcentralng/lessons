Assignment

Q1: 
    (a) Create a list of 10 decimals ensure the last decimal is less than 10.
        Use a conditional statement to determine whether the last decimal is less than 10.
        If it is, add a new decimal to the last that is exactly 0.9 points greater than the last one.
    (b) Use a conditional statement and indexing to print out all the decimal numbers that are greater than 5.8
    (c) Finally, remove the newly added decimal using a conditional statement and a list method

Q2: students = [{'name':'Hassan Usman', 'age':15, 'voterStatus':''}]
    using the students list above answer the following questions.
    (a) Populate the list with 4 more students using the appropraite list method(s)
